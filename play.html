        <h4>The Middle Class Gentleman </h4>
        <h6>The play opens with a great assembly of instruments, and in the
            middle of the stage is a pupil of the Music Master seated at a
            table composing a melody which Monsieur Jourdain has ordered for a
            serenade.</h6>
            <p>MUSIC MASTER: (To Musicians) Come, come into this room, sit there
                and wait until he comes.
                
                DANCING MASTER: (To dancers) And you too, on this side.
                
                MUSIC MASTER: (To Pupil) Is it done?
                
                PUPIL: Yes.
                
                MUSIC MASTER: Let's see... This is good.
                
                DANCING MASTER: Is it something new?
                
                MUSIC MASTER: Yes, it's a melody for a serenade that I set him to
                composing here, while waiting for our man to awake.
                
                DANCING MASTER: May I see it?</p>
