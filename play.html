        <h3>The Middle Class Gentleman </h3ssss>
        <h4>The play opens with a great assembly of instruments, and in the
            middle of the stage is a pupil of the Music Master seated at a
            table composing a melody which Monsieur Jourdain has ordered for a
            serenade.</h4>
           <pre> <h4>MUSIC MASTER: (To Musicians) Come, come into this room, sit there
                and wait until he comes.<br>
                
                DANCING MASTER: (To dancers) And you too, on this side.<br>
                
                MUSIC MASTER: (To Pupil) Is it done?<br>
                
                PUPIL: Yes.<br>
                
                MUSIC MASTER: Let's see... This is good.<br>
                
                DANCING MASTER: Is it something new?<br>
                
                MUSIC MASTER: Yes, it's a melody for a serenade that I set him to
                composing here, while waiting for our man to awake.<br>
                
                DANCING MASTER: May I see it?</h4></pre>
