        <h3>The Middle Class Gentleman </h3ssss>
        <h4>The play opens with a great assembly of instruments, and in the
            middle of the stage is a pupil of the Music Master seated at a
            table composing a melody which Monsieur Jourdain has ordered for a
            serenade.</h4>

                and wait until he comes.</p>
